# Matrix(back up plan)

## Why Have Backup plan

Because learning image recognition on Jetson Nano proved to be challenging and progress was slow, we collectively devised a backup plan.

## Aim

The project goal is to achieve a full score using Pixy and Matrix Mini, as only with a full score, there is a possibility to advance to the world competition.
